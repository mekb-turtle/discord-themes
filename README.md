# Discord themes

### [No Nitro annoyances](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mekb-turtle/discord-themes/main/no-nitro-annoyances.css)

"Send a gift" and "Add Super Reaction" don't work in other languages, I will fix this soon

the only way I found to target that button and nothing else was using the aria label which is localized, and I'm not doing it for all ~30 languages

also you may get a non-existent ping from Discord birthday tab, just turn off the style, click on it, and turn it back on

### [Blurred Backdrop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mekb-turtle/discord-themes/main/blurred-backdrop.css)

Blurs the background behind pop-up dialogs
